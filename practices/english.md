# Grammer
>- We use the present continuous for: **temporary situations**
    She usually works in London, but sheâ€™s working from home this week. (temporary situation)

>- We can specify time and place when asking for a description by using a phrase at the end of the question.
    What will the weather be like **next weekend**?
    What are the beaches like **in Barcelona**?

>- You **hardly ever** say you love me.

>- It is possible to ask questions with **Must + subject...**? but it is much more common to use **Do/Does + subject + have to...**?
    Do I have to come to the meeting tomorrow?(**Must I come** to the meeting tomorrow?)

>- We use the past simple for something that happened and finished in the past. We use it when we say or know the time when something happened. It is often used in stories, when one thing happened after another.
    Last year, we **travelled** by jeep across the Sahara.
    When the car **stopped**, we all **got** out.

>- We use the past continuous for something that happened in the past but was not finished at a particular time. This can be an exact time in the past(12 o'clock, etc.) or the time when another thing happened.
    It was 12 o'clock and we **were standing** in the midday sun.
    Mick **was checking** the engine when the rescue helicopter arrived.

>- We often use the past simple with time expressions like **yesterday, last month, six years, when I was a child.**

>- We use **be going to** for something that we expect to happen because we can see from the present situation that it is very likely. We can't use the present continuous in this way.
    It's so cold, I'm sure **it's going to** snow soon.
    Oh no! That **car's going to** hit the tree.

>- Use the present continuous and NOT the present simple for things that you have arranged to do. Use the present simple for future events on timeables and programmes.
    **We're going** by train tomorrow morning.
    **The train leaves** at 7:45.


>- **Followed by a gerund(-ing form)**
    admit, advise, consider, discuss, dislike, dread, enjoy, finish, mind, practice, recommend, suggest
>- **Followed by an infinitive**
    agree, appear, choose, decide, expect, fail, hope, learn, need, refuse, seem, wait, want

>- **Followed by either, with a change in meaning**
    forget, regret, remember, stop, try

> With verbs like **work** and **live**, which can describe permanent or temporary situations, we usually use the present perfect + 'for'/'since' for a long period of time. For a short period, we use the present perfect continuous.
    **I've worked** for this company **for 20 years**.(present perfect)
    **I've been working** here **for a week**.(present perfect continuous)

> If a situation is finished, we use past simple + 'for', not the present perfect:
    **I worked** for that company **for 20 years** and then I retired.
> When you listen to someone using a sentence with **for** + a period of time, listen carefully to the verb. It is sometimes difficult to hear the different between, for example, **I've lived in New York for five years** and **I lived in New York for five years**, but it makes a big difference in meaning. It tells us whether the speaker still lives there or not.

> After superlative adjectives, we usually use **in**, not **of**.
    He was the tallest person **in** his family.

> We use **might + verb, may + werb** or **could + verb** to talk about the possiblility of something in the present or the future.
    I **might go** to the exhibition at the Tate this afternoon.(future)
    We **might not move** into the new offices until the New Year.(future)
    He's travelling in Eastern Europe. He **may be** in Ukraine by now.(present)
    Our client **may not agree** with our suggestions.

> It's possible to ask question with **Might/May/Could + subject + infinitive without 'to',** but it is more common to form a question with **Do you think + subject + might/may/could + infinitive without 'to'**.
    **Do you think he might/may/could be** in Ukraine by now?

> We don't use **couldn't** in the same way as **might not/mightn't/may not**. 'Couldn't' means that something is impossible.

> I used to eat some cake last Saturday night.('Saturday night' was just one time, so it was not something done regularly.)

> **Too** describes something negative or unwanted, **enough** describes the right amount of something, and **very** makes the adjective stronger.

> For **degree**, we use **too + adjective**.
    It's **too hot** in here.

> For **amount** or **number**, the order is **too + many/much + noun**.
    James ate **too much pizza**.

> If we are making an indirect question from a direct question which already contains a question word, like **what, who, when, where or how**, we keep that same question word.
    (Direct question) - **What** is the dress code in the office?
    (Indirect question) - Could you tell me **what** the dress code is in the office?

> If the direct question doesn't have a question word, then we use **if** or **whether** in the indirect question. We can use these interchangeably, although **if** is a little more informal.
    (Direct question) - Is the coffee for everyone?
    (Indirect question) - Could you tell me **if** the coffee is for everyone?

> The **passive** is made with **subject + to be + past participle**. The verb **to be** is used to express both **present tense** and **past tense**.

> We use the first conditional to talk about possible future situation(or 'conditions') and their results. We use **if** for things we think are likely to happen, and **when** for things we think are certain to happen.
    **If I visit** London, **I'll stay** with friends.
    **When I visit** London, **I'll stay** with friends.

> **When you finsih** school, **what will you do**?
> **If we don't hurry**, we **will miss** the train.    
> **If you pass** your exams, **will you go** to university?

> We can use modals such as **may, might, can** or **should** in first conditional sentenses. **May** and **might** show we are less certain than when we use **will**.
    We **might** be late if the shops are busy.
    If you **can't** finish your homework tonight, you **can't** go out tomorrow.
    If I feel unwell tomorrow, I **may** stay at home.

> We can use **going to** or **the present continuous** with future meaning in the if/when part or the main part in first conditional sentenses.
    If we don't leave right now, we **are going to** be late.
    If you **are playing** tennis later, you'll need to take your racket.

> We can use **as long as** and **unless** with the same meaning as **if** and **if not** in first conditional sentenses.
    **As long as** we leave now, we won't be late.(= if we leave now, we won't be late.)
    **Unless** we leave now, we'll be late.(= If we don't leave now, we'll be late.)
