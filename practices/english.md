>- We use the present continuous for: **temporary situations**
    She usually works in London, but she’s working from home this week. (temporary situation)

>- We can specify time and place when asking for a description by using a phrase at the end of the question.
    What will the weather be like **next weekend**?
    What are the beaches like **in Barcelona**?

>- You **hardly ever** say you love me.

>- It is possible to ask questions with **Must + subject...**? but it is much more common to use **Do/Does + subject + have to...**?
    Do I have to come to the meeting tomorrow?(**Must I come** to the meeting tomorrow?)

>- We use the past simple for something that happened and finished in the past. We use it when we say or know the time when something happened. It is often used in stories, when one thing happened after another.
    Last year, we **travelled** by jeep across the Sahara.
    When the car **stopped**, we all **got** out.

>- We use the past continuous for something that happened in the past but was not finished at a particular time. This can be an exact time in the past(12 o'clock, etc.) or the time when another thing happened.
    It was 12 o'clock and we **were standing** in the midday sun.
    Mick **was checking** the engine when the rescue helicopter arrived.

>- We often use the past simple with time expressions like **yesterday, last month, six years, when I was a child.**

>- We use **be going to** for something that we expect to happen because we can see from the present situation that it is very likely. We can't use the present continuous in this way.
    It's so cold, I'm sure **it's going to** snow soon.
    Oh no! That **car's going to** hit the tree.

>- Use the present continuous and NOT the present simple for things that you have arranged to do. Use the present simple for future events on timeables and programmes.
    **We're going** by train tomorrow morning.
    **The train leaves** at 7:45.
