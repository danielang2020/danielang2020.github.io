# Insurance Terms
1. Grace Period: An insurance grace period is a defined amount of time after the premium is due in which a policyholder can make a premium payment without coverage lapsing.

2. APL: An automatic premium loan is an insurance policy provision that lets an insurer deduct an outstanding premium from the cash value of a policy.

3. Policy Loan: A policy loan allows you to access the cash value of a life insurance policy using the cash value as collateral.

4. Reduced Paid Up: Reduced paid-up insurance allows you to keep your policy in force even if you stop paying premiums. Instead of lapsing, your policy continues with a reduced sum assured, proportionate to the premiums already paid.

5. Surrender: voluntarily terminating a life insurance policy before its maturity date in exchange for the surrender value (cash value). This is usually done when the policyholder no longer wants to continue paying premiums or needs immediate cash.

6. PHD: A premium holiday deal is a feature in certain life insurance policies that allows policyholders to temporarily stop paying premiums while keeping the policy active. This is usually available in policies that have accumulated cash value or investment-linked funds.

7. Assignment: Assignment in insurance refers to the transfer of ownership rights of a life insurance policy from the policyholder to another person or entity. This means that the assignee gains legal control over the policy benefits, including claims and maturity proceeds.

8. Reinstatement: a person's previously terminated policy can resume if the already insured meets the specific requirements for reinstatement.

9. Rescind: the insurance company has decided that your coverage was never in effect and it is returning your premiums.

10. Vesting: The age at which the insured starts to receive the pension is called the vesting age. Once the vesting age is reached, the policy begins to release the annuity payout amount in the frequency mentioned in the policy.

11. Non-Lapse Guarantee period: a feature in certain life insurance policies that prevents the policy from lapsing due to insufficient cash value, as long as the minimum payments are made.

12. Survival Benefit: survival benefit is the payout given to the policyholder if they survive a certain period during the policy term.

13. Reversionary Bonus: a type of bonus declared annually by the insurer on participating life insurance policies. Once declared, it is added to the total payout, but whether it directly increases the sum assured or is added separately depends on the policy.

14. Top Up: a top-up refers to an additional premium payment made by the policyholder to increase investment or coverage in their existing policy.

15. ETA: extended term assurance is a non-forfeiture option available in whole life or endowment policies. If a policyholder stops paying premiums, the policy is converted into a term insurance policy with the same sum assured but for a shorter duration.

16. LAAR: A living assurance accelerated rider is a life insurance rider that  allows the policyholder to access a portion of the death benefit while they are still alive, in the event of being diagnosed with a critical illness or terminal illness.

16. Indexation: Indexation in insurance refers to the process of adjusting the coverage or benefits of an insurance policy in line with a particular economic index.

17. Par/Non-Par: A participating policy allows the policyholder to receive a share of the insurer's profits in the form of bonuses or dividends. A non-participating policy does not allow the policyholder to receive insurer bonuses or dividends, the benefits are fixed and guaranteed.

18. Endowment: An endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term ( on its maturity) or on death.

19. Loading: In some cases, an insurer may impose an extra charge to a standard premium to reflect any additional risk assumed. This is referred to as a 'loading'.

20. Attained Age: Attained age is the age of an individual at a specific point in time, usually the current age. In insurance terms, it refers to the age of the policyholder at the time the policy is issued or renewed.

21. Loading: It is an additional expense applied to the premiums for some risky individuals.
