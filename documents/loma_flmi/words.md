# Insurance words
1. Grace Period: An insurance grace period is a defined amount of time after the premium is due in which a policyholder can make a premium payment without coverage lapsing.

2. APL: An automatic premium loan is an insurance policy provision that lets an insurer deduct an outstanding premium from the cash value of a policy.

3. Policy Loan: A policy loan allows you to access the cash value of a life insurance policy using the cash value as collateral.

4. Reduced Paid Up: Reduced paid-up insurance allows you to keep your policy in force even if you stop paying premiums. Instead of lapsing, your policy continues with a reduced sum assured, proportionate to the premiums already paid.

5. Surrender: voluntarily terminating a life insurance policy before its maturity date in exchange for the surrender value (cash value). This is usually done when the policyholder no longer wants to continue paying premiums or needs immediate cash.
