# Insurance words
1. Grace Period: An insurance grace period is a defined amount of time after the premium is due in which a policyholder can make a premium payment without coverage lapsing.

2. APL: An automatic premium loan is an insurance policy provision that lets an insurer deduct an outstanding premium from the cash value of a policy.

3. Policy Loan: A policy loan allows you to access the cash value of a life insurance policy using the cash value as collateral.

4. Reduced Paid Up: Reduced paid-up insurance allows you to keep your policy in force even if you stop paying premiums. Instead of lapsing, your policy continues with a reduced sum assured, proportionate to the premiums already paid.

5. Surrender: voluntarily terminating a life insurance policy before its maturity date in exchange for the surrender value (cash value). This is usually done when the policyholder no longer wants to continue paying premiums or needs immediate cash.

6. PHD: A premium holiday deal is a feature in certain life insurance policies that allows policyholders to temporarily stop paying premiums while keeping the policy active. This is usually available in policies that have accumulated cash value or investment-linked funds.

7. Assignment: Assignment in insurance refers to the transfer of ownership rights of a life insurance policy from the policyholder to another person or entity. This means that the assignee gains legal control over the policy benefits, including claims and maturity proceeds.

8. Reinstatement: a person's previously terminated policy can resume if the already insured meets the specific requirements for reinstatement.

9. Rescind: the insurance company has decided that your coverage was never in effect and it is returning your premiums.

10. Vesting: The age at which the insured starts to receive the pension is called the vesting age. Once the vesting age is reached, the policy begins to release the annuity payout amount in the frequency mentioned in the policy.

11. Non-Lapse Guarantee period: a feature in certain life insurance policies that prevents the policy from lapsing due to insufficient cash value, as long as the minimum payments are made.
