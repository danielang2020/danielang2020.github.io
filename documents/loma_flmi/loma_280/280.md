## Chapter 1 Introduction to Risk and Insurance
Risk is the chance or possibility of an unexpected result, either a gain or a loss.

### The Concept of Risk
Speculative risk involves three possible outsomes: loss, gain or no change.

Pure risk involves no possibility of gain; either a loss occurs or no loss occurs.

The purpose of insurance is to compensate for financial loss, not to provide an opportunity for financial gain. 

### Risk Management
Risk management is the process in which individuals and businesses identify and assess the risks they face and determine how to deal with their exposure to these risks. Four general methods can be used to manage risk: (1) avoiding the risk, (2) controlling the risk, (3) transferring the risk, and (4) accepting the risk.

The most common way for individuals, families, and businesses to transfer risk is to purchase insurance coverage.

### Insurance
A company that accepts risk and makes a promise to pay a policy benefit if a covered loss occurs is an insurer or insurance company.

A policy benefit is a specific amount of money the insurer agrees to pay under an insurance policy when a covered loss occurs.

An insurance policy, also known as a policy or insurance contract, is a written document that contains the terms of the agreement between th insurer and the owner of the policy.

The premium is the specified amount of money an insurer charges in exchange for agreeing to pay a policy benefit when a covered loss occurs.

In general, individuals and businesses can purchase insurance policies to cover three types of risks:
- Personal risk
- Property damage risk
- Liability risk 

The applicant is the person or business that applies for an insurance policy.

Once an insurer issues a policy, the person or business that owns the insurance policy is known as the policyowner. In most cases, the applicant is also the policyowner.

The insured is the person whose life, health, or property is insured under the policy. In some countries, the term assured is used to refer to the person insured.

A third-party policy is a policy purchased by one person or business on the life of another person.

The beneficiary is the person or party the policyowner names to receive the life insurance policy benefit.

A request for payment under the terms of an insurance policy is called a claim.

### Managing Risks through Insurance
#### Characteristics of Insurable Risks
In general, for a risk - a potential loss - to be considered insurable, it must have the following characteristics:
- The loss must occur by chance.
The loss must result either from an unexpected event or from an event that the insured person did not intentionally cause.
- The loss must be definite.
For most types of insurance, an insurable loss must be definite in terms of time and amount.
A contract of indemnity is an insurance policy under which the amount of the policy benefit payable for a covered loss is based on the actual amount of the financial loss that results from the covered event, as determined at the time of the event.
A value contract specifies the amount of the policy benefit that will be payable when a covered loss occurs, regardless of the actual amount of the loss that was incurred.
- The loss must be significant.
- The loss rate must be predictable.
These predictions are based on observations of past events and a concept known as the law of large numbers.
- The loss must not be catastrophic to the insurer.
A loss without these characteristics generally is not considered an insurable risk.

By using accurate mortality and morbidity tables, life and health insurers can predict the probable loss rates for given groups of insureds. Insurers use those predicted loss rates to establish premium rates that will be adequate to pay claim.

#### Insurance Underwriting
The process of assessing and classifying the degree of risk represented by a proposed insured and making a decision to accept or decline that risk is called underwriting or risk selection. Insurance company employees who are responsible for evaluating proposed risks are called underwriters.

Underwriting becomes more difficult because of antiselection, also know as adverse selection or selection against the insurer.

Antiselection is the tendency of individuals who believe they have a greater-than-average likelihood of loss to seek insurance protection to a greater extent than do other individuals. The possibility of antiselection requires an insurer to carefully review each application to assess the degree of risk the company will be assuming if it issues the requested policy.

Underwriting consist of two primary stages: (1) identifying the risks that a proposed insured present and (2) placing the proposed insured into an appropriate risk class.

The most important of these factors to identify risks are physical hazards and moral hazards.
A phsical hazard is a physical characteristic that may increase the likelihood of loss. Moral hazard is a characteristic that exists when the reputation, financial position, or criminal record of an applicant or a proposed insured indicates than the person may act dishonestly in the insurance transaction.

Each insurer has its own underwriting guidelines, which are the general rules it uses when assigning proposed insureds to an appropricate risk class. Individual life insurers' underwriting guidelines usually identify at least four risk classes for proposed insureds: standard risks, preferred risks, substandard risks, declined risks.
Proposed insureds who have a likelihood of loss that is not significantly greater than average are classified as standard risks. Traditionally, most individual life and health insurance policies have been issued at standard premium rates.
Proposed insureds who present a significantly lower-than-average likelihood of loss are classified as preferred risks. Insurance company practices vary widely as to what qualifies a proposed insured as a preferred risk or standard risk.
Proposed insureds who have a significantly greater-than-average likelihood of loss but are still found to be insurable are classified as substandard risks or special class risks.
The declined risk category consists of those proposed insureds who present a risk that is too great for the insurer to cover.

#### Insurable Interest Requirement
Insurance is intended to compensate an individual or a business for a financial loss, not to provide an opportunity for gain.

An insurable interest means that the policyowner must be likely to suffer a genuine loss or detriment should be event insured against occur.


### Objectives
#### 1A. Distinguish between speculative risk and pure risk
> Speculative risk involves three possible outcomes: loss, gain, or no change. For example, when you purchase shares of stock, you are speculating that the value of the stock will rise and that you will earn a profit on your investment. At the same time, you know that the value of the stock could fall and you could lose some or all of the money you invested. Finally, you know that the stock could remain the same - you might not lose money, but you might not make a profit.
Pure risk involves no possibility of gain; either a loss occurs or no loss occurs. An example of pure risk is the possibility that you may become disabled.

#### 1B. Describe four methods used to manage financial risk
>1. Avoiding risk
>2. Controlling risk
>3. Transferring risk
>4. Accepting risk

#### 1C. Identify the five characteristics of insurable risks
>1. The loss must occur by chance.
>2. The loss must be definite.
>3. The loss must be significant.
>4. The loss rate must be predictable.
>5. The loss must not be catastrophic to the insurer.

#### 1D. Define antiselection and give examples of two factors that can increase or decrease the likelihood that an individual will suffer a loss
> Antiselection is the tendency of individuals who believe they have a greater-than-average likelihood of loss to seek insurance protection to a greater extent than do other individuals. 
A physical hazard is a physical characteristic that may increase the likelihood of loss. For example, a person with a history of heart disease possesses a physical hazard that increases the likelihood that the person will die sooner than a person of the same age and sex who does not have a similar medical history.
Moral hazard is a characteristic that exist when the reputation, financial position, or criminal record of an applicant or a proposed insured indicates that the person may act dishonestly in the insurance transaction. For example, an individual who has a confirmed record of illegal or unethical behavior is more likely than an individual without this type of background to act dishonestly in an insurance transaction.

#### 1E. Identify four risk classes for proposed insureds.
>1. preferred class
>2. standard class
>3. substandard class
>4. declined class

#### 1F. Define insurable interest and determine in a given situation whether the insurable interest requirement is met
> An insurable interest means that the policyowner must be likely to suffer a genuine loss or detriment should the event insured against occur.
To understand how insurable interest requirements are met, we need to consider two possible situations: 
(1) An individual purchases insurance on her own life. All person are considered to have more to gain by living than by dying.
(2) An individual purchases insurance on another's life. Certain family relationships are assumed by law to create insurable interest between an insured and a policyowner or beneficiary.
