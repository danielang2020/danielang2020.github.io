## Chapter 1 Introduction to Risk and Insurance
Risk is the chance or possibility of an unexpected result, either a gain or a loss.

### The Concept of Risk
Speculative risk involves three possible outsomes: loss, gain or no change.

Pure risk involves no possibility of gain; either a loss occurs or no loss occurs.

The purpose of insurance is to compensate for financial loss, not to provide an opportunity for financial gain. 

### Risk Management
Risk management is the process in which individuals and businesses identify and assess the risks they face and determine how to deal with their exposure to these risks. Four general methods can be used to manage risk: (1) avoiding the risk, (2) controlling the risk, (3) transferring the risk, and (4) accepting the risk.

The most common way for individuals, families, and businesses to transfer risk is to purchase insurance coverage.

### Insurance
A company that accepts risk and makes a promise to pay a policy benefit if a covered loss occurs is an insurer or insurance company.

A policy benefit is a specific amount of money the insurer agrees to pay under an insurance policy when a covered loss occurs.

An insurance policy, also known as a policy or insurance contract, is a written document that contains the terms of the agreement between th insurer and the owner of the policy.

The premium is the specified amount of money an insurer charges in exchange for agreeing to pay a policy benefit when a covered loss occurs.

In general, individuals and businesses can purchase insurance policies to cover three types of risks:
- Personal risk
- Property damage risk
- Liability risk 

The applicant is the person or business that applies for an insurance policy.

Once an insurer issues a policy, the person or business that owns the insurance policy is known as the policyowner. In most cases, the applicant is also the policyowner.

The insured is the person whose life, health, or property is insured under the policy. In some countries, the term assured is used to refer to the person insured.

A third-party policy is a policy purchased by one person or business on the life of another person.

The beneficiary is the person or party the policyowner names to receive the life insurance policy benefit.

A request for payment under the terms of an insurance policy is called a claim.

### Managing Risks through Insurance
#### Characteristics of Insurable Risks
In general, for a risk - a potential loss - to be considered insurable, it must have the following characteristics:
- The loss must occur by chance.
- The loss must be definite.
- The loss must be significant.
- The loss rate must be predictable.
- The loss must not be catastrophic to the insurer.
A loss without these characteristics generally is not considered an insurable risk.
