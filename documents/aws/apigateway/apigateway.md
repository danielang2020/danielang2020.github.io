# Amazon API Gateway
## Working with REST APIs
### Develop
#### Access control
##### Use Lambda authorizers
> A Lambda authorizer is useful if you want to implement a custom authorization schema that uses a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth or SAML, or that uses request parameters to determine the caller's identity.

### Optimize
#### Cache settings
> You can enable API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With cahcing, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API.
