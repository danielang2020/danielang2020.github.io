# Amazon CloudWatch Logs
## Analyzing log data with CloudWatch Logs Insights
> CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can perform queries to help you more efficiently and effectively respond to operational issues. If an issue occurs, you can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to identify potential causes and validate deployed fixes.

## Creating metrics from log events using filters
> You can search and filter the log data coming into CloudWatch Logs by creating one or more metric filters. Metric filters define the terms and patterns to look for in log data as it is sent to CloudWatch Logs. CloudWatch Logs uses these metric filters to turn log data into numerical CloudWatch metrics that you can graph or set an alarm on.

## Real-time processing of log data with subscriptions
> You can use subscriptions to get access to a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs and have it delivered to other services such as an Amazon Kinesis stream, an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose stream, or AWS Lambda for custom processing, analysis, or loading to other systems.
