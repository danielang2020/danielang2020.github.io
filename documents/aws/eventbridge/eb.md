# Amazon EventBridge
## Rules
### Creating a rule that runs when events are received
> To create a rule for events, you specify an action to take when EventBridge receives an event that matches the event pattern in the rule. When an event matches, EventBridge sends the event to the specified target and triggers the action defined in the rule.

### Craeting a rule that runs on a schedule
> You can only create scheduled rules using the default event bus.
