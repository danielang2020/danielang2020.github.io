# Amazon Route 53
## Registering domain names
### Registering domains 
> When you register a domain with Route 53, we automatically create a hosted zone for the domain and charge a small monthly fee for the hosted zone in addition to the annual charge for the domain registeration.  
## Configuring Amazon Route 53 as your DNS service
### Working with hosted zones
#### Working with private hosted zones
> A private hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want Amazon Route 53 to respond to DNS queries for a domain and its subdomains within one or more VPCs that you create with the Amazon VPC service.

### Working with records
#### Choosing a routing policy
##### Geolocation policy
> You can create a default record that handles both queries from ip address that aren't mapped to any location and queries that come from location that you haven't created geolocation records for. If you don't create a default record, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response from those location.
#### [Choosing between alias and non-alias records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html)
> When you use an alias record to route traffic to an AWS resource, Route 53 automatically recognizes changes in the resource. For example, suppose an alias record for example.com points to an ELB load balancer at lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com. If the IP address of the load balancer changes, Route 53 automatically starts to respond to DNS queries using the new IP address.
