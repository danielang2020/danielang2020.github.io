# AWS Account Management
## Using the root user
### Compare root user and IAM user
> There are two different types of users in AWS. You are either the account owner(root user) or you are an AWS Identity and Access Management(IAM) user. The root user is created when the AWS account is created. IAM users are created by the root user or an IAM administrator for the account. All AWS users have security credentials.
