# Amazon CloudFront
## What is Amazon CloudFront
### CloudFront pricing 
#### Choosing the price class for a CloudFront distribution
> By default, CloudFront responds to requests based only on performance. Objects are served from the edge location that has the lowest latency for the viewer. If you’re willing to accept potentially higher latency for viewers in some geographic regions in return for lower cost, you can choose a price class that doesn’t include all geographic regions. Some viewers, especially those in geographic regions that are not in your price class, might see higher latency than if your content was served from all CloudFront edge locations. For example, if you choose Price Class 100, viewers in India might experience higher latency than if you choose Price Class 200.
