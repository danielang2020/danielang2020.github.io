# AWS Organizations
## Managing policies
### Understanding policy inheritance
> Because you can attach policies to mulitple levels in the organization, accounts can inherit mulitple policies.  

### Service control policies
> SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. They affect only the member accounts in your organization.
