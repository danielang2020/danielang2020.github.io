# Elastic Load Balancing
## Listeners
> The X-Forwarded-For request header is automatically added and helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use an HTTP or HTTPS load balancer.  
> The X-Forwarded-For request header may contain multiple IP addresses that are comma separated. The left-most address is the client IP address where the request was first made.  

> The X-Forwarded-Proto request header helps you identify the protocol(HTTP or HTTPS) that a client used to connect to your load balancer.  

> The X-forwarded-Port request header helps you identify the destination port that the client used to connect to the load balancer.
