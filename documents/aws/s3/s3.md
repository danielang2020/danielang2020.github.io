## What is Amazon S3?
> Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUT and DELETE requests of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions. This behavior applies to both writes to new objects as well as PUT requests that overwrite existing objects and DELETE requests. In addition, read operations on Amazon S3 select, Amazon S3 access control lists(ACLs), Amazon S3 Object Tags, and object metadata are strongly consistent.  
## Working with buckets
### Buckets overview
> Amazon S3 supports global buckets, which means that each bucket name must be unique across all AWS accounts in all the AWS Regions within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions: aws(Standard Regions), aws-cn(China Regions), and aws-us-gov(AWS GovCloud(US)).

> Amazon S3 creates buckets in a Region that you specify. To optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements, choose any AWS Region that is geographically close to you.
