## Working with buckets
### Buckets overview
> Amazon S3 supports global buckets, which means that each bucket name must be unique across all AWS accounts in all the AWS Regions within a partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. AWS currently has three partitions: aws(Standard Regions), aws-cn(China Regions), and aws-us-gov(AWS GovCloud(US)).

> Amazon S3 creates buckets in a Region that you specify. To optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements, choose any AWS Region that is geographically close to you.
