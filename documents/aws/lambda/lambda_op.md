## Performance optimization
### Memory and computing power
> The amount of memory also determines the amount of virtual CPU available to a function. Adding more memory proportionally increases the amount of CPU, inreasing the overall computational power available. If a function is CPU-, network- or memory-bound, then changing the memory setting can dramatically improve its performance.
