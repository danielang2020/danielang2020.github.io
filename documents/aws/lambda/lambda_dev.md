# AWS Lambda(Developer Guid)
## Working with other services
### CloudFront(Lambda@Edge)
> Lambda@Edge lets you run Node.js and Python Lambda functions to customize content that CloudFront delivers, executing the functions in AWS locations closer to the viewer. The functions run in response to CloudFront events, without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Lambda functions to change CloudFront requests and responses at the following points:
>1. After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer(view request)
>2. Before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin(origin request)
>3. After CloudFront receives the response from the origin(origin response)
>4. Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer(viewer response)

## Lambda Quotas
> Function timeout is 900 seconds(15 Minutes)
